			<p class="paragraph">Some risks are firstly the addictiveness people spending prolonged time in vr due to addictiveness it literally is reality bending to your will you can be seen as exactley what you want to be seend as you can present yourself exactly how you want to dont like sometimes you can change it the world around you can change to whatever you like and ocean scene a dark cave or a castle straight out of fantasy with dragons and everything the potential for addictiveness dont like how you appear present yourself to others as an exagerated version of yourself or maybe you want to change completely you can become a wizard who casts magic spells or you can ocmpeltely flip the coin and appear as female when you actually male and viceversa and no one would be the wiser this could lead to trans people spending prolonged time in vr because they are unhappy with their reality.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Another risk is the norms and your behaviour vr norms and behaviour will obviously differ vastley from real societal norms and people adapt to new environments and the anonymity vr provides is another reason the norms differ spending prolonged time in vr can cause social disonnance and make people forget societal norms and behave strangley in reality. Another large risk is data collection oculus from facebook already does this this kind of data collection can be far more intrusive from seeing what people are doing to listening in as most vr sets have microphones and msot vr has cameras on the exterior aswell so this could let the data collection get glimpess of peoples real environments and virtual ones this is an unprecedented amount of data collection this is something there must be laws about before vr usage becomes widespread and more companies start implementing data collection on its vr users.</p>
