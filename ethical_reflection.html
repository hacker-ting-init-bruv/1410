			<p class="paragraph">Ethics is something that should be at the forefront of any vr development moving foward as vr becomes more mainstream because unlike computers vr is more intrusive it takes over your senses and fools you into being in a virtual reality there fore anything in the virtual reality looks and feels far more real and can cause ptsd because of how traumatic certain things can be there must be ethical guidelines the vr developers must self impose limits they cannot take it to far there must be certain limits otherwise there can be misuse of vr such as people using is for psycological torture and if they dont secure the technology properly hackers can take over the users Vr and put up whatever they please causing distress in the user this can lead to trauma and ptsd and who knows how long the effects could last so i propose the vr developers and manufacturers must take ethical consideration and guidlines into account before they become a problem and before vr usage inevitably becomes widespread.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">another major concern is vr how addictive it can be your in a reality you can control therefore you can appear and present yourself to others in anyway you please to can sit in worlds completely bending to your will this an be addicitve for several reasons maybe the user dosent have a good life and use vr for far to long to avoid the real world and their problems and this can cause social dissonince in the user or maybe they dont like themselves in reality and perfer how they present themselves virtually if people can hide from their real problems in vr the real world will start to fall apart around them and the problems get worse so they keep hiding in vr and they spend more and more prolonged time in vr this will lead to a social disconnect for the user losing real relationships in favour or virtual ones for this reason i propose we must start setting up proper safegaurds now and prapare support for vr addictions espicially as vr becomes more widespread/mainstream gaming addictions despite being around for ages are only now being taken into account so i urge society to be ahead of the curve this time.</p>
